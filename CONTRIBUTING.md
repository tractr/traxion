## Discussions

**Our community is a safe and friendly environment, where we support and treat each other with respect**.

We invite you to actively participate in discussions on Github, and [Discord](https://discord.traxion.dev/).

You'll see many discussions about usage or design questions, but any topic is welcome.
They are a great foundation to find potential issues, feature requests or documentation improvements.

## Issues

New bug reports require to be triaged. Oftentimes this includes creating a minimal reproduction, or verifying that the
problem still occurs on the latest stable version or the unstable channel (see below).

When you're starting to look into fixing a bug, create a WIP PR that you mention in the original issue. This way, we
ensure that everyone interested can share their thoughts, and duplicate work is prevented.

Adding tests is a great way to help prevent future bugs.
