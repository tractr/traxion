### Content generation

When developing, to test the changes you are making in the generators you will have to generate multiple time
in a row to get the correct generation. To speed up your development you can use this commands:

```bash
npm run pregenerate && npx prisma generate
```

It will generate you the code without run the prettier and lint formatters.

You'll need to run `npm run generate` one time before your commits to send the correct generated code.
