# Traxion

Traxion is a suite of code generators for TypeScript, built upon the Prisma schema. The goal of this project is to eventually offer a comprehensive suite of generators that can generate a full-stack application, including all CRUD operations and authorization, using only the Prisma data schema as the source of truth.

The first generator in the suite is a NestJS-GraphQL generator based on a Prisma model. A tutorial for this generator is available and we encourage you to read it to get started.

More generators, such as front-end generators, will be added to the Traxion suite in the future.

## Getting Started

To get started with Traxion, please follow the [NestJS-GraphQL generator tutorial](https://www.traxion.dev/docs/getting-started/).
