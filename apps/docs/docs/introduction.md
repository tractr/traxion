# Overview

Traxion is a suite of NodeJS packages that aims to accelerate the development of web applications.
The objective is to allow you to focus on business logic and to get rid of routine tasks.

## Frameworks & tools

Traxion is fully developed with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and is designed primarily with open-source blocks.
Traxion is not trying to reinvent the wheel. It is above all a careful assembly of pre-existing components.
Here is a list of the most important blocks:

- [Angular](https://angular.io/) Front-end framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) Front-end framework (coming soon)
- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) A progressive Node.js framework for building server-side applications.
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) Node.js and TypeScript ORM
- [NX](https://nx.dev/) Build system for monorepos
- [Schematics](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/tree/master/packages/angular_devkit/schematics) A scaffolding library for the modern web.
- [Hapify](https://docs.hapify.io/) Template engine for CRUD operations
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) Infrastructure as code
- and many others...
