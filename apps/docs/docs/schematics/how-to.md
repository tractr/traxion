## How to use the schematics

At the root of your nx project you can use the schematics from `@tractr/schematics`. First you need to install this package from npm:

```bash
npm i --save-dev @tractr/schematics
```

After that you will be able to use the schematics with the `nx` cli:

```bash
nx g @tractr/schematics:<schematicName> ...
```
