To use and start to documents this repository we use [`docusaurus`](https://docusaurus.io/) under the hood
and it was generated via `@nx-plus/docusaurus`.

You can check directly their [documentation](https://github.com/ZachJW34/nx-plus/tree/master/libs/docusaurus) and start enjoying the docusaurus world.
