## Github Actions

Github Actions are a way to automate tasks that can be performed on a git repository.

### Import Github Actions with schematic

```shell
nx g @tractr/schematics:github-workflows --all
```

This will add workflows defined [here](https://github.com/tractr/stack/tree/main/libs/schematics/src/generators/github-workflows/files).
