## Use an existing schematic

From the root of your NX project you can use the schematics from `@tractr/schematics`.
First, you need to install this package with `npm`:

```shell
npm i --save-dev @tractr/schematics
```

After that, you will be able to use the schematics with the `nx` cli:

```shell
nx g @tractr/schematics:<schematicName> ...
```

:::caution

  Some schematics add dependencies in `package.json` but don't run `npm install` for you. You will need to run `npm install --force` yourself.

## Create a new schematic

To create a new schematic you can use the `nx-plugin:generator` schematic from `@nrwl`.

```shell
nx g @nrwl/nx-plugin:generator <schematicName> --project=schematics
```
