// No decent way exists to use XMLHTTPRequest in node with typescript
// xhr2 does not provide any type
// Waiting https://github.com/pwnall/node-xhr2/pull/20 to be merge into main
// The best solution would be to wait rxjs to natively support node with xhr
// Or waiting https://github.com/mcmunder/universal-rxjs-ajax/issues/13
	
declare module 'xhr2';
